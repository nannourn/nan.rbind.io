I am a dual-major doctoral candidate in the Department of [Fisheries & Wildlife](https://fw.msu.edu) and [Ecology, Evolution & Behavior Program](https://eeb.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. When not trekking deep into tropical jungles or pursuing North American big game on Western public lands, I enjoy spending time with my cat Max and bunny Boca while learning about wildflowers and native grasses with my partner Jacquie.

For the 2024-2025 academic year, I am currently residing abroad in Phnom Penh, as a [U.S. Student Fulbrighter](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program) in Cambodia. Currently, I am collaborating with local conservation NGOs to develop statistical models in gaining insights towards population dynamics of threatened native wildlife species.

You can contact me via email at nan\[at\]msu.edu.
