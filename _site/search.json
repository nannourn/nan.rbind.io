    "text": "One of the key steps in making “improvements” on your R journey is to write code that is more clear, succinct, concise and short; for me, this usually occurs when I need to create multiple plots of variables when exploring a dataset.\nI find myself usually making simple bar plots using ggplot and geom_col() to count things. Instead of copying-and-pasting the same ggplot code and altering the the column names in the code like a newbie hack, I recently learned about double curly braces “{{ }}” which allow you to dynamically pass unquoted variable names within functions.\nFirst, we’ll use the palmerpenguins package to make some bar plots (Yeah, I am fully aware that I should’ve worked with some Spotify/Apple Music Bay Area music datasets to make this blog post even more hyphy). I examine the penguins dataset to see which columns are categorical/discrete and numerical/continuous:\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n\npenguins %&gt;% glimpse()\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           &lt;fct&gt; Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n\n\nAn easy first look at exploring a dataset is to simply count the number of items in a variable. I want to determine the counts across the categorical columns and make a bar plot for each. That happens to be the species, island and sex columns. Here’s the long way how to do it:\nCodepenguins %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  count(species, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  mutate(species = fct_reorder(species, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = n)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip()\npenguins %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  count(island, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  mutate(island = fct_reorder(island, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = n)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip()\npenguins %&gt;% \n  drop_na() %&gt;% \n  count(sex, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  mutate(sex = fct_reorder(sex, n)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = n)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code demonstrated above, I realize that all I am just changing is the name of the columns (species, island, sex) to create the three different plots. The rule of thumb is to succint programming is to avoid duplication of code – twice is fine but thrice is too much! Here, we can attempt to create a function to shorten the number of lines written. We create a function (I named it geomcol_discrete) with the nifty use of the double curly brackets { column } to maintain a tidyverse work flow:\n\nCode# function - discrete plots\ngeomcol_discrete &lt;- function(tbl, column) {\n  tbl %&gt;% \n    drop_na() %&gt;% \n    count({{ column }}, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% \n    mutate({{ column }} := fct_reorder({{ column }}, n)) %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = {{ column }}, y = n)) + \n    geom_col() +\n    coord_flip()\n}\n\n\nAnd now we quickly plot with geomcol_discrete:\nCodepenguins %&gt;% geomcol_discrete(species)\npenguins %&gt;% geomcol_discrete(island)\npenguins %&gt;% geomcol_discrete(sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also created a function to plot histograms for the continuous data geomhist_continuous:\nCode# function - continuous plots\ngeomhist_continuous &lt;- function(tbl, column) {\n  tbl %&gt;% \n    drop_na() %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = {{ column }}, fill = species)) +\n    geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8)\n}\n\n# now we quickly plot\npenguins %&gt;% geomhist_continuous(bill_length_mm)\npenguins %&gt;% geomhist_continuous(bill_depth_mm)\npenguins %&gt;% geomhist_continuous(flipper_length_mm)\npenguins %&gt;% geomhist_continuous(body_mass_g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step further would be to create a vector of column names so that I can loop the functions. Stay tuned for a future update. As the Bay Area hip-hop lingo would dictate, We out here tryin’ to function!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbay area native H.E.R."

    "text": "As a wildlife biologist, one of the first steps in exploring spatial analyses with R is to produce a map with recorded (x, y) locations of your species of interest; for example, many researchers mark animal locations with a handheld Garmin GPS or obtain location data from GPS collars, and would like to see on a map where all the occurrences of their study animals have been recorded. I remember it took me forever just to learn this basic exercise so I thought it would be a nice blog post for students in the same position and beginning their spatial journey in becoming a SAP (Spatially Aware Professional).\nFor #InternationalLeopardDay, I thought it would be a fun and simple exercise to download recorded leopard (Panthera pardus) occurrence records from the GBIF database and to produce a basic leopard occurrence map.\nThe Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) platform provides open access to biodiversity data, where many scientists have produced species distribution models and maps to explore global ranges for various wildlife species. We’ll download leopard location data from GBIF and explore their range. Note: Like all open source databases, not all information inputted will be accurate. We’ll have to use our best judgment to identify outlier points in GBIF, which mostly are attributed to user error.\nWe’ll be using dismo, sf and tidyverse packages to download GBIF data and tidy our spatial data. Remember, if you’re starting to work exclusively with spatial data, sf is a package I suggest that you should spend some considerable time with.\n\n1 Packages\n\nCodelibrary(dismo)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(maptiles)\n\n\n\n2 Downloading the data\nI use the gbif function to download records for leopards (Panthera pardus). I also use the option geo=FALSE to download records without numerical georeferences (records that do not come with location x,y data). nrecs is the argument to download the max number of records at a time, which is 300.\n\nCodepardus &lt;- dismo::gbif(\"Panthera\",\"pardus\", geo = FALSE, nrecs = 300) \npardus %&gt;% \n  as_tibble() %&gt;% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 208\n  acceptedNameUsage acceptedScientificName   acceptedTaxonKey accessRights adm1 \n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                               &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;\n1 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus kotiya …          5219437 &lt;NA&gt;         Mone…\n2 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus kotiya …          5219437 &lt;NA&gt;         Mone…\n3 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus (Linnae…          5219436 &lt;NA&gt;         West…\n4 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus pardus            7193915 &lt;NA&gt;         Nort…\n5 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus fusca (…          5219442 &lt;NA&gt;         Raja…\n6 &lt;NA&gt;              Panthera pardus pardus            7193915 &lt;NA&gt;         Mpum…\n# ℹ 203 more variables: adm2 &lt;chr&gt;, associatedOccurrences &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   associatedReferences &lt;chr&gt;, associatedSequences &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   basionymAuthors &lt;chr&gt;, basionymYear &lt;chr&gt;, basisOfRecord &lt;chr&gt;, bed &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   behavior &lt;chr&gt;, bibliographicCitation &lt;chr&gt;, canonicalName &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   catalogNumber &lt;chr&gt;, class &lt;chr&gt;, classKey &lt;int&gt;, cloc &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   collectionCode &lt;chr&gt;, collectionID &lt;chr&gt;, collectionKey &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   combinationAuthors &lt;chr&gt;, combinationYear &lt;chr&gt;, continent &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\n3 Tidying the data\nThe data tibble seems to look okay, with at least 9,882 records being downloaded. With many columns of information provided by GBIF, we are mainly interested in lon and lat (x,y data) and locality. Let’s summarize our data by determining among the downloaded records, how many have coordinates, and how many records do not have coordinates but have a textual geo-reference (locality description).\n\nCode# total number of records\npardus %&gt;% count() \n\n     n\n1 9905\n\nCode# looking at how many NA lon-lat records there are\npardus %&gt;% \n  group_by(lon, lat) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::count(sort = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  unite(\"loc\", lon:lat, sep = \",\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(loc = fct_reorder(loc, n)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  loc                     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1 NA,NA                2500\n2 35.420663,31.491912   495\n3 35.315413,31.492047   132\n4 34.965783,32.67288     66\n5 32.15,28.7666          60\n\nCode# looking at a sample of localities recorded with NA coordinates\npardus %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(lat) | is.na(lon)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(locality, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(locality = fct_reorder(locality, n)) %&gt;% \n  slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n                                 locality n\n1                            Ituri forest 1\n2                             Cochinchine 2\n3                           Rumathe River 1\n4                 Ahl al Oughlam - Site 1 3\n5                          Laristan, Fars 1\n6                             Mount Elgon 1\n7  Deutsch-Ostafrika (aus Familienbesitz) 1\n8                                  África 1\n9                              Masai Mara 1\n10                              Ethiopean 2\n\n\nSo out of ~9,800 records downloaded, 2,500 records do not have geo-referenced coordinates and were inputted as (NA,NA) in the dataset. A lot of the records that were not geo-referenced but had a recorded locality listed were sightings of leopards from zoos, and records that wouldn’t be too particularly useful in producing a map, such as “Africa”, “on Simiyu River”, “see remarks”, etc.\n\n4 Static Map\nNow it’s time to make a simple map. We just want to use records with (lon, lat) from our pardus tibble frame. From the sf package, we want to create an sf spatial object by using the st_as_sf() function to retrieve the coordinates, and then use the st_set_crs() function for our projection of choice.\nWe use the geom_sf() function with ggplot2 to put all the points together on the world map. Additionally, we can use the new tm_basemap() function to spice up our tmap.\n\nCode# create sf obect with coordinations and projection\npardus_sf &lt;- pardus %&gt;% \n  filter(lon != is.na(lon) | lat != is.na(lat)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"), remove = FALSE) %&gt;% # key function \n  st_set_crs(4326)\n# load World map from tmap package\ndata(World)\n# combine sf objects to produce ggplot map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = World) +\n  geom_sf(data = pardus_sf, aes(color = \"Panthera pardus\"), alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Panthera pardus occurrences\",\n       subtitle = \"Source: GBIF\") +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"locations\",\n                     values = \"black\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# tmap\ntm_shape(pardus_sf) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"black\", fill_alpha = 0.4) +\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_basemap(\"OpenTopoMap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome thoughts on the initial global map include records indicating leopards occurring in North and South America and Europe, which come as a surprise to me. These were probably occurrences in zoos or other captive facilities listed by public citizens. Thus, it is probably best to know a few things on current distribution of your focal species of interest before integrating records from public databases, such as GBIF. Also, I am aware I did not include a north arrow or scale bar for this map, as this is only a draft and not finalized for any publications.\nHowever, we can create a second map that focuses on Africa and Asia continents to get a clearer look at more natural leopard occurrences. We do this by filtering the areas of interest (Africa and Asia) in our World object. We then make sure the projections for both pardus_sf_aa and africa_asia objects are the same so that we can use the st_intersection() function to clip the locations that fall outside our Africa and Asia polygon, so that points in North America, South America and Europe don’t show up on the map. The st_crs() argument is handy for extracting the CRS information from an object, and the st_transform() argument lets you change the CRS information for a given object. Changing the alpha value on the pardus_sf_aa points can show the density of locations; darker points show us that an aggregation of occurrences are mainly in southern Africa and India.\n\nCode# filter world map for asia and africa continent\nafrica_asia &lt;- World %&gt;% filter(continent==\"Africa\" | continent == \"Asia\")\n# set CRS for africa_asia the same as pardus\nmyCRS &lt;- st_crs(pardus_sf)\nafrica_asia &lt;- africa_asia %&gt;% st_transform(myCRS)\n# check CRS\nst_crs(africa_asia)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:4326 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Horizontal component of 3D system.\"],\n        AREA[\"World.\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nCodest_crs(pardus_sf)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:4326 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Horizontal component of 3D system.\"],\n        AREA[\"World.\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nCode# now union\npardus_sf_aa &lt;- st_intersection(pardus_sf, africa_asia)\n# combine sf objects to produce ggplot map\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = africa_asia) +\n  geom_sf(data = pardus_sf_aa, aes(color = \"Panthera pardus\"), alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Panthera pardus occurrences in Africa and Asia\",\n       subtitle = \"Source: GBIF\") +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"locations\",\n                     values = \"darkorange\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# tmap\ntm_shape(pardus_sf_aa) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"darkorange\", fill_alpha = 0.4) +\n  tm_graticules() +\n  tm_basemap(\"Esri.WorldTopoMap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Interactive Map\nI am also a big fan of producing interactive maps for quicker access to explore the data interactively. tmap provides an html interactive map mode for this task.

    "text": "2.1 REDD+\nOngoing global deforestation within and adjacent to tropical forest ecosystems has led to continued decline of wildlife populations and rampant habitat degradation, contributing to the loss of critical ecosystem functioning and biodiversity decline affecting critical environmental and ecological processes such as disruptions to trophic cascades, climate and hydrological regulation. This continued degradation is especially prominent in Global South countries where a majority of the world’s tropical biomes and biodiversity remain.\nReduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is a voluntary global scale climate change mitigation program aiming at creating financial values for carbon stored in forests, and aimed at offerring incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation [citation].\nIn many cases, REDD+ provides an avenue for potential forest protection by providing financial-based incentives as conservation projects through reduced forest loss against a defined baseline (Pauly et al., 2022). Through this mechanism, REDD+ proponents have supported the notion that Global North nations can contribute to sustainable development in Global South nations by investing in these carbon markets created through theoretical protection of forests.\nIn an effort to curtail forest loss and combat deforestation, REDD+ program schemes have been implemented globally in developing tropical regions along with generating carbon credits to be used. Generally, the funds obtained from these voluntary markets are used to better improve deforestation efforts, and promote conservation projects such as improving law enforcement, development alternative incomes for local communities, and research and monitoring of natural resources within protected areas.\nThere is growing interest to monitor biodiversity for REDD+ projects (Dickson and Kapos, 2012), however, there are few published papers that look at this specific instance where REDD+ projects are targeting biodiversity monitoring. (Dickson and Kapos, 2012) summarize the state of biodiversity monitoring within established REDD+ projects. (Waldon et al., 2011) suggest that it is necessary to assess whether REDD+ management and project areas are achieving maintaining and improving biodiversity status, indicating a need to monitor changes and trends in populations of key indicator taxa for the project area. They maintain that while IUCN criteria are useful at a global scale, global wide assessments may not adequately reflect regional or localized concerns; therefore, assessments should be made at local and regional scales to identify biodiversity conservation targets. Camera trapping and acoustic methods are both non-invasive ways to collect biodiversity at an economical and time sensitive rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nInsert sources to make the link between the benefits of managing a REDD+ landscape entails a necessity to monitor biodiversity levels, thus also improving ecosystem functioning for the (tropical forest) region."

    "text": "2.2 Cambodia\nCambodia is known as a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000); however, Cambodia is plagued with deforestation problems due to rampant corruption along with a lack of strong enforcement to safeguard natural resources [need citation]. High powered companies and individuals are likely to benefit from the selling of land concessions and forest trees from converting land use to large-scale farm plantations and other industrial needs [need citation]. Cambodia is also a developing country meeting high demand for a growing population, in turn the country has the need to develop and expand infrastructure to support civil society. The main drivers of biodiversity decline are attributed through habitat loss from deforestation along with illegal poaching of wildlife for trade markets.\nIn collaboration with the Cambodian Ministry of Environment (MoE), Conservation International-Cambodia (CI) has had a long-term partnership with the goal to conserve tropical forest natural resources. Various conservation programs such as protected area management, biodiversity monitoring and community livelihood improvements have been implemented to assess drivers of deforestation and other illegal activities regarding natural resources in PLWS.\nTo generate carbon credits for sale, CI and MoE initiated the JCM REDD+ program in PLWS to ensure sustainable financing for the program and protection of PLWS. Between 2018 to 2021, the JCM REDD+ Project Phase 1 was implemented in Stung Treng within PLWS, while Phase 2 project proposal was signed by MoE, CI, and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., (Mitsui) in April 2021 to extend the project objectives to include the other three provinces of Kampong Thom, Kratie, and Preah Vihear, with a completed end date goal of 2026.\nTo assess and monitor baseline populations of key taxa, robust and reliable population density estimates require robust statistical techniques to separate observation and ecological processes within surveyed REDD+ landscapes."

    "text": "2.3 Distance Sampling to Estimate Abundance and/or Density\nDistance sampling (DS) has been one of the most prominent statistical frameworks used in wildlife science to estimate population abundance and/or densities for vertebrate animals. The benefits of utilizing distance sampling is that data collection methods are relatively logistically simple, as surveys require only counting animals and obtaining the distance the animal occurrence is away from the transect line. Surveys do not have stringent temporal nor spatial requirements, as transect surveys are only conducted once per season and do not require individual animals to be marked or caught.\nIn traditional conventional DS, population estimates are made by calculating a detection function based on the distribution of distances to individuals observed. All distances and observations are pooled together across the entire study area. With this pooled data, the detection function is based on the distribution of observed distances, and is used to calculate estimated densities of animals. In effect, this estimation is adjusted for non-detection bias. Conventional DS methods do not account for effects of habitat covariates on densities, thus wildlife managers managing on a landscape level scale require further information on habitat-animal relationships.\n\n2.3.1 Hierarchical Distance Sampling (HDS)\nHowever, modern estimates of wildlife populations need to take account imperfect detection and uncertainty when making reliable animal density estimates for the important fact of wildlife conservation management. Hierarchical models through the use of Bayesian statistics provides a robust, flexible framework where we are able to seperate the ecological and detection process through a hierarchical modeling framework through Bayesian statistical methods.\nWe examine the affect of environmental and human covariates and how this affects localized greater hornbill densities across spatially replicated transects in Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary. (Royle et al., 2004) utilized hierarchical distance sampling in order to examine the effect of covariates on abundance.\nThis analytical framework allows flexibility for rarely collected data, especially in transects that were met with logistical constraints (Sillett et al., 2012)."

    "section": "\n2.4 Great Hornbills",
    "text": "2.4 Great Hornbills\nHornbills are large forest birds classified in the order of Bucerotiformes (Corlett, 2017) consisting of 15 genera, 62 species; with 32 species inhabiting Asia and 25 species in Africa (Poonswad et al., 2013). Prominent characteristics are an oversized, long curved bill with a casque on top. Hornbills are known as the most important single family of seed dispersal agents for large-woody species in the forest canopy (Corlett, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMore information about the status of hornbill species throughout mainland Southeast Asia will be updated here, with mainly studies from Thailand comprising the majority of the literature for the region.\n\n\nHornbills can be considered an important keystone species for tropical forest biomes, due to their outsized contribution to ecosystem functioning from their role as seed dispersers. Thus, it is imperative to understand the current population dynamics of hornbills within the landscapes they reside in, and how hornbills are potentially impacted by increasing anthropogenic threats in tropical rainforests.\nTo understand the presence of hornbill species at a landscape scale, attention must be paid to the configuration of tree canopies and their effect on distributions of hornbills in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. Hornbill habitat use is often associated with the tallest trees in the forests due to their ability to produce large fruits. Utilizing 3D forest canopy structure, (Russo et al., 2024) determined that hornbill species preferred areas greater in canopy height and vertical complexity.\nGreater hornbill (GH) Buceros bicornis can be found in Cambodia occurring through their natural habitat of dense tropical evergreen forest. Although there have been a number of studies dedicated towards understanding hornbill ecology within Southeast Asia, there has been no robust study as of yet aiming to understand current levels of hornbill densities and distribution throughout their range in Cambodia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMore information about the status of hornbill species in Cambodia will be udpated here.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Previous Hornbill Studies Utilizing Distance Sampling\nA number of peer-reviewed studies have incorporated line transect surveys and distance sampling (DS) analyses to estimate hornbill densities from different regions of the world. Sriprasertsil et al. (2024) conducted variable-width line transect surveys and used multi-covariate distance sampling to estimate hornbill densities from June 2021 to June 2022 in two protected areas in Southern Thailand: Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary and Budo Su-Ngai Padi National Park. Pradhan et al. (2024) estimated abundances for four hornbill species: Great Hornbill, Wreathed Hornbill, Rufous-necked Hornbill, Oriental Pied-Hornbill) in the highly-fragmented and highly-modified Buxa Tiger Reserve in northern West Bengal, India. Researchers used line transects and multi-covariate distance sampling to estimate densities recording hornbill species, flock size, time of sighting, activity (perched, foraging, call and flight) and perpendicular distance from the observer to the bird. Predictor variables (elevation, density of fruiting trees, cut logs, total basal area) and hornbill occurrence was explored using a generalized linear model with binomial error structure with all hornbill occurrences pooled together. Pawar et al. (2021) utilized distance sampling methods to estimate abundance of Great Hornbills and Malabar Grey Hornbills in two contrasting habitat types in protected area rainforests versus fragmented habitat consisting of coffee plantations in India. They found that both hornbill species used both habitat types year-round. Their main findings include determining that distance sampling estimates were higher in protected areas for both nesting and non-nesting seasons.\nTo date, there have been no formal estimates of population abundance for hornbills in Cambodia (Setha, 2004), thus our goal was to estimate Great hornbill population estimates for the entirety of the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary landscape, while simultaneously understanding the effects of habitat variation at landscape scale could potentially affect density estimates."

As one of the largest areas of contiguous lowland tropical forests left in mainland Southeast Asia, PLWS was established in 2016 and covers four provinces including 1) Kampong Thom, 2) Preah Vihear, 3) Kratie and 4) Stung Treng.\nPLWS is notable for its immense biodiversity, providing critical refuge for up to 55 globallythreatened vertebrates including gibbons, Asian elephants, and clouded leopards, while having up to 538 plant and tree species. PLWS is also critical in that it supports more than 250,000 people inhabiting the forest, including the indigenous Kuy people who reside in and around this protected area. PLWS also serves as an important watershed for the Mekong and the Tonle Sap lake.\nWhile maintaining protected area status, PLWS continues to face enormous natural resource extraction pressure due to weak enforcement of environmental laws and lack of resources. Illegal forest logging, wildlife trade, land encroachment, and unsustainable agricultural practices have led to continued degradation of quality forest habitat.\nPLWS is comprised mainly of evergreen and semi-evergreen forest, mixed with some deciduous forests and savanna grasslands."

Transect grids were composed of four 1-km lines forming a square grid, totaling 4 km in walked transect length (1 km^2).\nBefore data collection, transect lines were cleared using machetes to create a trail no more than one meter in width to ensure minimum impacts on local vegetaion. Trails were painted blue every 10 to 20 meters, while transect grid corners were painted by applying paint on trees. Field training and practice trials were conducted before implementation of data collection.\nFifteen key biodiversity species were selected and targeted for biodiversity monitoring at PLWS.\nData collection occurred during January to May 2023 during Cambodia’s dry season. Transect grids were mainly completed in evergreen and semi-evergreen forest, with a few transect lines conducted in dry deciduous forest habitat.
