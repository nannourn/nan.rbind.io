  abstract = {Most forests are impacted by humans and are at the center of numerous species extinctions. Wilderness areas (i.e., areas with little or no human influence) are essential to limit biodiversity loss and are expected to have the most intact natural communities. The southern Yungas are neotropical mountain forests affected by unsustainable human activities that may pose a risk for many species. We used camera trap data, multispecies occupancy models, and regional human footprint index to assess the occupancy of medium- and large-sized mammal assemblage in wilderness areas and the effect of human influence variables in the southern Yungas forests of Salta and Jujuy provinces, Argentina. The occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, red-brocket deer (Mazama rufa), tapeti (Sylvilagus paraguensis), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and tayra (Eira barbara) was higher in wilderness areas than in areas with human influence. When one human influence variable of the human footprint index was analyzed at a time, greater distance from hamlets (i.e., small, isolated human houses) resulted in higher occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, jaguar (Panthera onca), crab-eating fox, and lowland tapir. Distance to transformed areas had no significant effect on occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, a positive effect on lowland tapir, and a negative effect on grey-brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira). Distance to roads did not affect the occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage or species. Wilderness areas in the southern Yungas contribute substantially to the conservation of medium- and large-sized mammal assemblage~and should be prioritized in conservation strategies.},

  abstract = {Organisms are subject to physical forces that influence morphological evolution. Birds use their bills as implements to perform various functions, each exerting unique physical demands. When excavating cavities, bird bills must resist a range of mechanical stresses to prevent fracture. However, the contribution of bill geometry and material composition to excavation stress resistance remains poorly understood. Here, we study the biomechanical consequences of bill diversification in the cavity-excavating palaeotropical barbets. Using finite-element models and beam theory, we compare excavation performance for two loading regimes experienced by barbet bills during cavity excavation: impact and torsion. We find that deeper and wider maxillae perform better for impact loads than for torsional loads, with the converse for narrower maxillae. This results in tradeoffs between impact and torsion resistance imposed by bill geometry. Analytical beam models validate this prediction, showing that this relationship holds even when maxillae are simplified to solid elliptical beams. Finally, we find that composite bill structures broadly exhibit lower stresses than homogeneous structures of the same geometry, indicating a functional synergy between the keratinous rhamphotheca and bony layers of the bill. Overall, our findings demonstrate the strong link between morphological evolution, behaviour and functional performance in organisms.},

  abstract = {Most tropical plants produce fleshy fruits that are dispersed primarily by vertebrate frugivores. Behavioral disparities among vertebrate seed dispersers could influence patterns of seed distribution and thus forest structure. This study investigated the relative importance of arboreal seed dispersers and seed predators on the initial stage of forest organization--seed deposition. We asked the following questions: (1) To what degree do arboreal seed dispersers influence the species richness and abundance of the seed rain? and (2) Based on the plant species and strata of the forest for which they provide dispersal services, do arboreal seed dispersers represent similar or distinct functional groups? To answer these questions, seed rain was sampled for 12 months in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. Seed traps representing five percent of the crown area were erected below the canopies of 90 trees belonging to nine focal tree species: 3 dispersed by monkeys, 3 dispersed by large frugivorous birds, and 3 wind-dispersed species. Seeds disseminated by arboreal seed dispersers accounted for ca 12 percent of the seeds and 68 percent of the seed species identified in seed traps. Monkeys dispersed more than twice the number of seed species than large frugivorous birds, but birds dispersed more individual seeds. We identified two distinct functional dispersal groups, one composed of large frugivorous birds and one composed of monkeys, drop dispersers, and seed predators. These groups dispersed plants found in different canopy strata and exhibited low overlap in the seed species they disseminated. We conclude it is unlikely that seed dispersal services provided by monkeys could be compensated for by frugivorous birds in the event of their extirpation from Afrotropical forests.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal is a key process in plant communities and frugivory is very important in vertebrate communities. This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Passive restoration of secondary forests can partially offset loss of biodiversity following tropical deforestation. Tree cavities, an essential resource for cavity-nesting birds, are usually associated with old forest. We investigated the restoration time for tree cavities suitable for cavity-nesting birds in secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) in central Amazonian Brazil. We hypothesized that cavity abundance would increase with forest age, but more rapidly in areas exposed to cutting only, compared to areas where forest was cut and burned. We also hypothesized that cavities would be lower, smaller, and less variable in secondary forest than in old-growth forest, which at the BDFFP is part of a vast lowland forest with no recent history of human disturbance. We used pole-mounted cameras and tree-climbing to survey cavities in 39 plots (each 200\>{\texttimes}\>40 m) across old-growth forests and 11--34-year-old secondary forests. We used generalized linear models to examine how cavity supply was related to forest age and land-use history (cut only vs cut-and-burn), and principal components analysis to compare cavity characteristics between old-growth and secondary forest. Cavity availability increased with secondary forest age, regardless of land-use history, but the oldest secondary forest (31--34 years) still had fewer cavities (mean\>{\textpm}\>SE\>=\>9.8\>{\textpm}\>2.2 cavities ha--1) than old-growth forest (20.5\>{\textpm}\>4.2 cavities ha--1). Moreover, secondary forests lacked cavities that were high and deep, with large entrances---characteristics likely to be important for many species of cavity-nesting birds. Several decades may be necessary to restore cavity supply in secondary Amazonian forests, especially for the largest birds (e.g., forest-falcons and parrots\>\&gt;\>190~g). Retention of legacy trees as forest is cleared might help maintain a supply of cavities that could allow earlier recolonization by some species of cavity-nesting birds when cleared areas are abandoned.

  abstract = {The responses of hornbills to selective logging were determined by comparing their diversity and abundance in five habitats classified according to logging history. Relative abundance of three hornbill species was compared along trails in recently logged forest, 20--25-year-old logged forest, unlogged primary forest, a relatively disturbed primary forest and a plantation in Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining reserve forests in western Arunachal Pradesh. The species recorded were the Oriental pied hornbill               Anthracoceros albirostris               , wreathed hornbill               Aceros undulatus               and great hornbill               Buceros bicornis               . The great hornbill was the most common species overall and its abundance varied across habitats, being highest in unlogged forest. The Oriental pied hornbill, which was recorded in only two habitats, seemed to show a distinct habitat preference for secondary growth, rivermargin forests. Wreathed hornbill abundance did not differ between habitats. Differences in species abundance probably reflect aspects of their ecology, such as degree of territoriality, diet and movement patterns, and differential vulnerability to hunting and disturbance. Great hornbill abundance was correlated with large tree density (GBH {$\geq$} 150 cm) and basal area characteristic of unlogged primary forests, while Oriental pied hornbill abundance was negatively correlated with tall forest, indicating its greater numbers in low-stature river-margin forest. Wreathed hornbill abundance was not correlated with any vegetation variable, which is probably related to its reported nomadic movements in search of fruit patches. Hornbill abundance was not correlated with densities of potential food and nest tree species. Although hornbill abundance was not correlated with fig tree density, this was probably because areas where relative fig tree densities were lower often contained a few large fruiting figs. Because hornbills are large mobile birds, they can find resources such as fruiting figs even in otherwise unsuitable habitat.},

Hornbills fed on fruits of 49 plant species that comprised over 95 percent of their diet. Hornbill species partitioned food resources by varying the relative contribution of figs and non-fig fruits in the diet. Similarity in non-fig fruit diet was low. Ten species contributed to over 90 percent of the non-fig diet. The availability of non-fig fruits was much lower in the nonbreeding season than in the breeding season; however, despite lower fruit availability during the nonbreeding season, hornbills had a wide diet breadth and indirect evidence suggests that Wreathed Hornbills foraged widely in this season for fruit. Great Hornbills relied more on figs that were available year-round. The diverse diet breadth that included rare and patchy fruit resources underscores the importance of conserving large forest tracts for hornbills.},

Information on two nests of Rufous-necked Hornbill               Aceros nipalensis               in higher-elevation forests is also presented. All species nested in live trees of three tree genera, 83\% (               n               = 36) in               Tetrameles nudiflora               , an emergent deciduous softwood, relatively common in lowland foothill forests. No difference was recorded in nest-tree species or nesting habitats of sympatric hornbills, but there were a few differences in structural characteristics of nest-trees. Cavity size was the main variable separating the three species. Great Hornbills used larger cavities while Oriental Pied Hornbills used smaller cavities closer to riverine areas. Nesting was attempted at 64\% of known sites and successful fledging of chicks was 80\% overall (               n               = 72 nests, pooled over 4 years). Nest-trees in disturbed habitats near human habitation were used but were often abandoned or unsuccessful and 50\% of all nest-trees were inactive by the end of the study. Potential large nest-trees had a density of 5.9/ha, that of the two most used species was 1.3/ha, and minimum nest densities of all three species was about 1 pair/km               2               . Interference competition for nest-sites was not observed, despite similarity in nest-tree characteristics, low nest density and high loss of nest-trees. Nest-site availability may naturally limit hornbill populations in the area, and additional loss of nesting habitat to human activities may exacerbate limited availability of breeding sites.},

  abstract = {Most bird species that nest in tree cavities globally occur in diverse assemblages in little-studied tropical and subtropical forests which have high rates of habitat loss. Conservation of these communities will require an understanding of how species traits, such as body size, influence nest-site selection. We examined patterns of nest-site selection of secondary cavity-nesting birds at the nest patch, tree and cavity scale, and investigated how these patterns are influenced by body size. Using conditional logistic regression, we compared characteristics of 155 nest tree cavities paired with 155 unused tree cavities in quebracho               Schinopsis balansae               forests in Chaco National Park, Argentina (2016--2018). The odds of a cavity being used for nesting increased with its depth and height above ground, decreased with entrance size, and were greater for dead trees than live. Small-bodied (13--90\,g) species used floor diameters in proportion to availability, but medium- (150--200\,g) and large-bodied (400--700\,g) species selected cavities with larger floors. Model selection indicated that characteristics at the nest patch scale (canopy cover, tree density) had little effect on nest-site selection when cavity-scale variables were included. Cavity floor diameter, entrance size, cavity height and tree diameter (but not cavity depth) increased with body mass, and larger bird species more often used live trees. Two tree species proved to be key for the community: large and medium-sized birds used almost exclusively large live               Schinopsis balansae               , whereas small birds used live and dead               Prosopis               spp. in a proportion greater than its availability. Small birds could be differentiated according to species-specific cavity characteristics, but medium and large species overlapped considerably with one another. Although body mass explained much of the overall variation in tree and cavity characteristics between small and medium/large species, several small-bodied species consistently used cavities outside of the expected characteristics for their body size, suggesting that other natural history traits may play important roles in nest-site selection by small-bodied birds. To retain the full suite of secondary cavity-nesters in species-rich tropical and subtropical forests, it is necessary to conserve a diversity of trees and cavities that meet the full range of nesting requirements of these trait-diverse communities.},

  abstract = {Avian frugivores across Southeast Asia, and in the Philippines in particular, are seriously threatened owing to massive loss of habitat and direct exploitation through hunting and the pet trade. Their declines may have dire consequences for wider ecological processes as many frugivores are also seed dispersers. Twenty-five species of pigeons, parrots and hornbills were surveyed using distance sampling along nearly 500 km of line transects at 14 sites across the island of Luzon. We documented surprisingly few reliable disappearances of frugivores from individual forest patches -- in fact ours and other fieldwork since 2000 have increased the known extent of occurrence of several species. However, green racquet-tail Prioniturus luconensis has been recorded at only seven out of 29 historic sites in the last 10 years; although possibly a function of poor coverage, this may be a real range contraction. Still more alarming was the absence of large parrots from most sites with apparently intact habitat surveyed. Even where present, large parrots exhibited lower densities than related species in similar habitat in Southeast Asia. Multiplying site-specific density estimates by reserve area, we estimated population sizes for species in five reserves selected from the current protected area network. For six species, including four of six parrots, largest populations in any reserve in Luzon numbered {$<$} 1000 individuals, and nearly one-third of all populations in reserves were {$<$} 100. Given differing opinions and evidence on minimum viable population (MVP) thresholds, we used a range of MVP values to predict the likelihood that frugivore populations will persist in various reserves. At MVPs of 500, frugivore communities in all but 2--3 of the largest reserves are not expected to survive. Although seed dispersers may fare better than seed predators (large parrots), and many frugivores are good fliers that can disperse between widely separated sites, we express the concern that without stricter species and site protection a major collapse of frugivore communities may occur across Luzon, with serious implications for ecosystem functioning.},

Methods{\enspace}               Distributional data of 544 resident forest and forest edge bird species of Thailand and the Thai--Malay peninsula were examined at 45 sites spanning 15{$^\circ$} of latitude from northern-most Thailand to the southern peninsular Malaysia. Sites were grouped into 23{$\quad$}degree or half-degree latitudinal zones and avifaunal similarity coefficients were calculated between each zone.                                         Results{\enspace}               A Mantel test revealed a significant transition between northern Indochinese and southern Sundaic (Indomalay) avifauna assemblages just north of the Isthmus of Kra (10{$^\circ$}30{$\prime~$}N). Northern and southern range limits of 152 species ({$>\quad$}269 species and subspecies combined) lie between 11{$^\circ$} and 13{$^\circ~$}N.                                         Main conclusions{\enspace}               This transition between zoogeographical subregions is not coincident with the widely recognized transition between floristic provinces which is traditionally placed 400--500{$\quad$}km further south at the Kangar--Pattani line, but is associated with a change from wet seasonal evergreen dipterocarp rain forest to mixed moist deciduous forest north of the Isthmus of Kra in the northern Thai--Malay peninsula. Climatological and ecological factors associated with the distribution of forest types today are reviewed and it is hypothesized that the avian transition tracks the northern phytogeographical boundary. Palaeogeographical factors, including hypothetical Neogene seaways, which may account for the historical development of both phytogeographical and avifaunal transitions are also described.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of seed dispersal for survival of plant species in fragmented landscapes, data on seed dispersal at landscape scales remain sparse. Effective seed dispersal among fragments determines recolonization and plant species persistence in such landscapes. We present the first large-scale (216-km2) direct estimates of realized seed dispersal of a high-value timber tree (Dysoxylum malabaricum) across an agro-forest landscape in the Western Ghats, India. Based upon an exhaustive inventory of adult trees and a sample of 488 seedlings all genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci, we estimated realized seed dispersal using parentage analysis and the neighbourhood model. Our estimates found that most realized seed dispersal was within 200 m, which is insufficient to effectively bridge the distances between forest patches. We conclude that using mobility of putative animal dispersers can be misleading when estimating tropical tree species vulnerability to habitat fragmentation. This raises serious concerns about the potential of many tropical trees to recolonize isolated forest patches where high-value tree species have already been removed.},

Captive breeding programs in Thailand maintain many Great Hornbills, however active genetic management of captive hornbills was not incorporated into the species recovery plan. With Great Hornbill reintroductions planned for northern Thailand in the immediate future, lack of genetic profiles and phylogenetic relationships among potential founders might hamper population recovery efforts. We assessed the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) diversity, genetic structure, and evolutionary history of 97 captive Great Hornbills across five zoos in Thailand. Among the 97 samples, we found 21 haplotypes with a haplotype and nucleotide diversity of h = 0.81336 {\textpm} 0.021 and pi = 0.00108 {\textpm} 0.00040, respectively. The maintenance of mitogenome diversity and no genetic differentiation between five captive populations (FST = 0.00000--0.09723, p {$>$} 0.05) might be a result of frequent founder exchange among facilities. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of a southern clade BBITH13, indicating a genetically distinct southern population. To protect these genetic lineages and maintain adaptability of hornbills that have been reintroduced, breeding facilities that contain unique haplotypes should be given high priority in breeding plans. Our data support the evolutionary value of the captive hornbill population in Thailand and highlight the significance of incorporating active genetic management strategies into the species recovery plan for Great Hornbills.},

Lipid--rich fruits, produced by several interior forest trees mainly of the family Lauraceae, were highly seasonal in their availability, and their production in the dry, hot season coincided with the breeding of the hornbill. Sugary fruits, produced mainly by several species of               Ficus               , were available year--round due to aseasonal fruiting patterns. Because               Ficus               fruited even at times of low fruit resource availability, and was heavily utilized by hornbills and other frugivores, it played a keystone role in the maintenance of the avian frugivore community. Overall fruit production was scarce between July and January during the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons.               Vitex altissima               produced berries abundantly during much of this time (September--December) and thus was another important fruit resource for avian frugivores. To safeguard the fruit resource base for the Great Pied Hornbill, we recommend: (1) The protection of               Ficus               and               Vitex               trees from overexploitation, and (2) the conservation of forest integrity to maintain compositions and densities of the lipid--rich fruit tree species utilized by the hornbill.},

We conducted 620 1-h lookout watches over the forest canopy from 14 elevated locations along 13.1 km of paved road through Bala, during which we recorded all detections and movements of target species. For a further 619 h, we also recorded all in-forest detections of target species during excursions along and adjacent to the road. Our records covered all months of the year and hours of the day, enabling us to estimate seasonal and diurnal patterns of detection for each target species. We found significant seasonal and diurnal variation for all commoner species in rates of overall detection, visual versus aural detection, and vociferousness. We related most monthly variation to the timing of nesting and most hourly variation to aspects of the behavioural ecology of each species. We used three techniques to estimate dispersion and density for each species, two from lookouts based on our counts of individuals or breeding units per unit area observed, and one from spot maps of core breeding units within 500 m of the road. Differences in our estimates of density varied within and between species, but were mostly lowest for the mean number of individuals detected from lookouts and highest for the maximum of breeding units, whether from lookout detections or core area counts from spot maps. These ranges of densities and their variance indicate upper and lower estimates for each species, and the differences between them and other survey techniques were explicable partly by the behavioural ecology of each species or apparent changes in density. Our density estimates never exceeded the highest comparative estimates for target species or near relatives in other forest habitats, although few were available for diurnal raptors. We suggest that 1-h lookout watches over forest, where feasible, offer alternative and efficient estimates of detection, dispersion and density to conventional distance-sampling techniques conducted from within forest. They will achieve optimum accuracy when conducted during the most detectable periods for target species, particularly for obvious and sparsely dispersed bird species.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ground-hornbill (SGH) (Bucorvus leadbeateri) is considered an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation in savannah biomes since they require large territories and significant protection measures that help to conserve a wide range of biodiversity with similar savanna and grassland requirements. Declines of the species are attributed to low reproductive rates coupled with multiple anthropogenic threats, including secondary poisoning, and persecution. Little is known about connectivity and population structure of SGH populations in Africa, south of the equator. Knowledge of population differentiation is needed to ensure that targeted conservation management plans can be implemented to slow population declines and ensure survival of the species. To inform a long-term conservation strategy, we investigated the broad-scale population structure of Southern Ground-hornbill across their sub-equatorial range. Our study based on 16 microsatellite loci identified moderate variation (average of 5.889 alleles per locus and a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.546) similar to other long-lived avian species. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA sequences analysis identified low diversity (Hd = 0.3313, {$\pi$} = 0.0015). A Bayesian assignment approach, principal component analysis, analysis of molecular variance and phylogenetic analysis identified weak to moderate population structuring across long distances and mitochondrial data showed a shallow phylogeny. Restriction to long-distance dispersal was detected that could not be attributed to isolation by distance, suggesting that other factors, such as their dispersal biology, are shaping the observed genetic differentiation. Although our study does not support the designation of populations as independent conservation units, we advocate that population management should continue to follow the Precautionary Principle (mixing founders from the same range state, rather than allowing mixing of founders from the extremes of the range) until there is scientific certainty. Following further research, if no independent conservation units are detected, then the global captive population can contribute to reintroductions across the range. In the wild, populations at the edge of the species range may need additional management strategies and gene flow should be promoted between neighbouring populations.},

Fruit production did not show any discernable patterns over 22 months of study, in spite of the strong seasonality of rainfall. Figs were available in all months of the year, and fig biomass exceeded ripe nonfig-fruit biomass in 10 of 22 months. Hornbill densities fluctuated dramatically over time  and among habitats. Spatial and temporal variation in hornbill numbers was best explained by habitat selection and the abundance and distribution of figs. Hornbill numbers were higher in those areas with greater densities of fig trees, and monthly hornbill densities and mean flock size increased with increasing fig biomass. Because Sulawesi Red-knobbed Hornbills appear to track fig production over potentially large distances, and include a mix of other rainforest tree species in their diet, we hypothesize that they may play an important role as agents of rainforest regeneration.},

  abstract = {Abstract:                            Avian diet selection is hypothesized to be sensitive to seasonal changes in breeding status, but few tests exist for frugivorous tropical birds. Frugivorous birds provide an interesting test case because fruits are relatively deficient in minerals critical for reproduction. Here, we quantify annual patterns of fruit availability and diet for two frugivorous hornbill (Bucerotidae) species over a 5.5-y period to test for patterns of diet selection. Data from the lowland tropical rain forest of the Dja Reserve, Cameroon, are used to generate two nutritional indices. One index estimates the nutrient concentration of the diet chosen by               Ceratogymna atrata               and               Bycanistes albotibialis               on a monthly basis using 3165 feeding observations combined with fruit pulp sample data. The second index is an estimate of nutrient concentration of a non-selective or neutral diet across the study area based on tree fruiting phenology, vegetation survey and fruit-pulp sample data. Fifty-nine fruit pulp samples representing 40 species were analysed for 16 nutrient categories to contribute to both indices. Pulp samples accounted for approximately 75\% of the observed diets. The results support expected patterns of nutrient selection. The two hornbill species selected a diet rich in calcium during the early breeding season (significantly so for               B. albotibialis               in July and August). Through the brooding and fledging periods, they switched from a calcium-rich diet to one rich in iron and caloric content as well as supplemental protein in the form of invertebrates. Calcium, the calcium to phosphorus ratio and fat concentration were the strongest predictors of breeding success (significant for calcium and Ca:P for               B. albotibialis               in June). We conclude that hornbills actively select fruit based on nutritional concentration and mineral concentration and that the indices developed here are useful for assessing frugivore diet over time.},

  abstract = {Although point transect distance sampling methods have become widely used in surveys of forest birds, there has been no attempt to tailor field methods to maximize the accuracy of abundance estimates by minimizing the effects of violations of the method's critical assumptions, which are: (1) birds at distance 0 m are detected with certainty, (2) birds are detected at their initial location and (3) distances to objects are measured accurately. We investigate the effects on abundance estimates for Philippine forest birds of varying the count period from 2 to 10 min, and of including and excluding a pre-count settling down period. Encounter rates were highly sensitive to count period length but density estimates from 10-min count periods were, on average, only 13\% higher than those from 2-min periods, and in several cases were actually lower than those from periods of 6--8 min. This was because birds tended to be recorded at greater distances from the recorder as the count period went on, thus `stretching out' detection functions while having little effect on detection rates close to the recorder. For some bird groups, including canopy frugivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, density estimates were more than twice as high without than with a settling down period. We suggest that movement away from the recorder is more common than attraction to the recorder, and that unless pilot studies show otherwise, similar studies should not use a settling down period for surveying many species. Count periods that maximized probability of bird detection close to the central point while minimizing the unwanted effects of bird movement during the count period were: 4 min for omnivores, 6 min for nectarivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, 8 min for understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores, and a full 10 min for sallying insectivores, ground-dwellers, carnivores and coucals/koels. We use the results to suggest `group-specific' count period regimes that could help maximize the accuracy of density estimates from similar studies of tropical forest birds.},

  abstract = {Studies on the ranging behaviour of birds often suggest that ranges vary seasonally with larger ranges in the non-breeding compared to the breeding season. However, due to limitations in tracking methods very little is known about the underlying processes driving seasonal differences in ranging behaviour, especially in fragmented, heterogeneous landscapes. Such knowledge is particularly important if movements deliver essential ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal. We contrasted the daily ranging behaviour between the breeding and non-breeding season of a frugivorous bird and demonstrate how larger seasonal ranges in the non-breeding season emerge through switching from a stationary home range behaviour to nomadism. We tracked movements of 29 male trumpeter hornbills Bycanistes bucinator across a fragmented landscape of eastern South Africa during different breeding and non-breeding seasons using high temporal resolution GPS data-loggers. Birds in the breeding seasons showed a typical, stationary home range pattern. In the non-breeding seasons birds, rather than expanding their stationary daily ranges, switched to nomadic movements that were characterized by shifts of the general location of daily ranges to a different area every couple of days. We also found that during the breeding seasons hornbills were mostly located in large continuous forests; birds in the non-breeding seasons frequently used forest patches within the agricultural landscape and residential areas. These seasonal differences in the movement behaviour of trumpeter hornbills may have important consequences for seed dispersal of plant species. Our findings show how seasonal range expansion of frugivorous birds may be driven by fundamental behavioural changes that have important consequences for ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Hornbills (family Bucerotidae) are important frugivores and seed dispersers of Asian tropical forests. While much is known about the diets and their role as seed dispersers at the local or landscape scale, the lack of a comprehensive, standardised, and digital database on hornbill frugivory and seed dispersal interactions hampers broader and comparative studies across hornbill species and with other avian frugivore groups. To fill this crucial gap, we compiled a species-level database of plant-hornbill interactions in tropical Asia from primary sources throughout the literature; the database consisting of 2365 interaction records for 26 Asian and New Guinea hornbill species (out of the 32, or 80\% of, species), a testament to the efforts of numerous hornbill biologists and ecologists. Fruits or seeds from 471 plant species, 240 genera and 84 families were reported to be consumed. Significant gaps in data coverage, however, remain. Rarefaction curves based on interaction records are not strongly saturating, revealing the scale of the ``Eltonian shortfall'', that is, the paucity of species interaction information for many species. Our database also reveals a dearth in information on seed fate of hornbill consumed fruits and seeds. While approximately 58\% of the interaction records provided were implied or reported to be associated with seed removal, only about 26\% and 1\% of studies provide any indication of seed deposition and post-depositional seed viability, respectively. To conclude, we briefly illustrate the value of the dataset for investigating broad patterns in hornbill frugivory. By combining our dataset with complementary hornbill beak and plant trait data, we show that hornbills consume and potentially disperse seeds of many plant species that would be beyond the physical capabilities of other avian frugivores. We were also able to recover a positive relationships between hornbill beak sizes and the size of the fruits and seeds they consumed though the patterns were generally weak, possibly due to the low sample size and afore-mentioned gaps in data coverage. In light of these data gaps, it is clear that more hornbill frugivory and seed dispersal research is needed, and we hope that our database will be a valuable, central resource for future hornbill research.},

  abstract = {The suitability of point count distance methods for estimating densities of tropical parrots and hornbills was assessed during surveys in Indonesia. The methods will perform well, so long as the following are considered. (1) Enough bird records must be accumulated to model species' detection curves precisely. For some species, around 2000 point counts may be needed and, in very rare species, the method may not be appropriate. Pooling data across habitats, species or years may increase precision in cases of small sample size. (2) Point counts are likely to be less biased than line transects because bird detection rates close to the recorder may be higher and there may be less chance of double-counting birds. Distances greater than 400 m between census points are unnecessary. (3) Count periods lasting ten minutes may be needed to ensure that most birds close to the recorder are detected. Controlled flushing of concealed birds after the main count period may also be appropriate. (4) The best time of day for census is the period when bird detectability is high but bird mobility low. For many large avian frugivores, this corresponds to the period between one hour after dawn and 10.30 h. (5) Records of flying birds must be excluded from density calculations. In the species studied, between 2\% and 20\% should be added to density estimates to compensate for the exclusion of flying birds.},

Blue-eyed Cockatoo               Cacatua ophthalmica               and Blyth's Hornbill               Rhyticeros plicatus               were usually rarer in forest gardens than in primary forest, but both fared well in logged forest. Eclectus Parrot               Eclectus roratus               was more common in all human-altered forests than in primary forest, and Eastern Black-capped Lory               Lorius hypoinochrous               was reasonably common throughout but extremely abundant in forest gardens at one site. Parrots and hornbills were recorded eating fruits of 15 tree species and flowers of nine species. Densities of these fruiting and flowering trees were highest in logged forest and forest gardens, respectively, indicating the importance of these anthropogenic habitats as feeding grounds for the assemblage. Active nest cavities were found in large individuals of 12 tree species. Densities of potential nest cavities were highest in primary forest and lowest in forest gardens. At both sites, estimates of potential nest-site density were significantly lower than estimates of the density of pairs of all species of parrots and hornbills: there may be 10--20 parrot/hornbill individuals per nest-hole. Continuing forest alteration, whilst further reducing nest-site availability, may allow large populations of parrots and hornbills to persist due to increased availability of food in some anthropogenic habitats. However, current abundance of such bird species may be a poor correlate of future extinction risk as long-lived taxa may remain common for some period even when annual recruitment has declined to critically low levels.},

  abstract = {Continuing disappearance and degradation of primary tropical rainforests in Indonesia, and the ongoing conversion of degraded forest to monoculture plantations, threaten many bird species with local extinction. Yet, information on bird populations from the Sundaic region, which covers western Indonesia, is generally lacking, limiting our understanding of species responses to disturbance, extinction risks, and potential ways to counteract local species extinction processes. On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, bird density information is only known from two studies (on four hornbill species and one pheasant species). Here, we compare bird densities between less degraded and highly degraded forests within the Harapan Rainforest Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra. From a total of 148 bird species recorded, densities were calculated for 47 species with the highest encounter rate, 33 of which were recorded in forests of both disturbance levels, allowing comparisons to be made. We found five species with higher densities in the highly degraded forest and seven species with higher densities in the less degraded forest. While our species-specific results were generally consistent with previous biological insights, there were exceptions, such as a species previously considered to be sensitive to habitat degradation, the sootycapped babbler Malacopteron affine, being more abundant in the highly degraded forest. Our study revealed that despite its condition, degraded forest retains much value for Sumatran lowland forest birds, providing a compelling argument for securing its important conservation status under improved management, rather than assigning it for clearance as typically happens.},

Among these is the endangered Visayan Hornbill (                 Penelopides panini                 ), found on the islands of Panay and Negros. Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, its population size is thought to have declined from 1800 individuals 20~years ago to less than 1000. However, a recent study on Negros estimated 3564 individuals across three core forest blocks. This study aims to quantify the Visayan Hornbill population size in and around the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park (NWPPNP) on Panay, the largest contiguous low-elevation forest landscape remaining across its range, and its broad habitat associations across a gradient of environmental degradation.                                                        Methods                                Hornbills were surveyed using 10-min distance sampling point counts (                 n                 \,=\,367) along transects (average length 1.1~km). Environmental variables were recorded along transects, while habitat was classified into primary forest, secondary forest, plantation, or open habitat. Distance software was used to estimate population densities stratified by habitat, with the overall population estimate taken as a mean of habitat density estimates weighted by habitat area. Using generalized linear mixed models, hornbill occurrence was modelled using combinations of nine environmental variables as main and two-way fixed effects.                                                        Results                                Surveys covered 204.4 km                 2                 of the 374.8 km                 2                 Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbills were not recorded in plantations or open habitats. Hornbill density was significantly higher in primary forest (17.8 individuals/km                 2                 \,{\textpm}\,26.9\% CV) than in secondary forest (3.7 individuals/km                 2                 \,{\textpm}\,33.2\% CV;                 z                 \,=\,15.212,                 P                 \,{$<$}\,0.001). The overall population estimate for the NWPPNP and environs is 2109 individuals, and 2673 individuals for the entire Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbill presence was best explained by a model including distance from the Park boundary alongside five interaction effects and transect as a random effect. Distance, and the interaction between distance and medium-sized trees were significant predictors of hornbill presence.                                                        Conclusions               Our study evidences the habitat preference of the Visayan Hornbill, highlights the importance of the NWPPNP for the species' conservation, and provides strong evidence for re-assessing the global population size.},

However, vital information on their abundance from the region remains scanty. Understanding spatiotemporal variation in densities provides crucial information for formulating effective conservation strategies based on species-specific abundance patterns and population trends. We examined spatiotemporal variation in densities of four hornbill species in the Namdapha Tiger Reserve, a site identified as an important site for hornbill conservation in Asia. We collected data through variable-width line transect sampling (effort=842.1 km) in the non-breeding season from 2009-12 to estimate hornbill densities. We had 458 detections of four hornbill species. We have estimated White-throated Brown Hornbill densities (7.9 birds/km               2               ) for the first time throughout its entire range. The mean Rufous-necked Hornbill densities (6.9 birds/km               2               ) were higher than those reported elsewhere. Great (3.9 birds/km               2               ) and Wreathed Hornbill (16.1 birds/km               2               ) densities were comparable with other sites. The peak densities of all hornbill species in November-December are among the highest reported from Asia. Wreathed Hornbill densities showed temporal variation peaking in November-December (68 birds/km               2               ) and drastically declining by March-April (1.3 birds/km               2               ), indicating seasonal altitudinal movement to low-elevation areas outside the reserve during the breeding season. Our results underscored the spatial variation in hornbill distribution, with low densities of Great and the White-throated Brown hornbills in higher elevations. Our study demonstrates the global importance of Namdapha for hornbills, given its large area and high densities of four hornbill species.},

Ninety-one per cent of the 64 foraging sightings of the great hornbill were on figs while more than 50\% of the foraging sightings of the wreathed (83) and rufous-necked hornbills (87) were on non-fig fruits. At the largest scale, wreathed hornbill abundance and ripe fruit abundance peaked in the non-breeding season. At the intermediate scale, wreathed hornbill abundance was positively associated with non-fig fruit availability while rufous-necked hornbill abundance was negatively associated with non-fig fruit availability. At the smallest scale, great and rufous-necked hornbill abundances were correlated with fig and non-fig fruit crop sizes, respectively. The three hornbill species track fruit availability at different scales based on diet, which has implications for their role in seed dispersal.},

Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked hornbills               Aceros nipalensis               was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills               Rhyticeros undulatus               was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of rufous-necked hornbill were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill               Buceros bicornis               and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist over most of the landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal by frugivores is vital to the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. However, determining the influence of different frugivores over the distribution of their food plants is difficult, given the complexity of these interactions in the tropics. Consequently, most studies have been restricted to small scales, examining seed dispersal and establishment associated with nests, roosts or fruiting trees. Here, we evaluate the role of frugivorous hornbills in dispersing seeds at spatial scales of 1 ha. We monitored hornbills and seed rain at a tropical forest site in north-east India. We quantified the abundance of hornbill food plants and recruits of large-seeded plants. We estimated removal rates of dispersed, large seeds to determine post-dispersal seed fate. We found that the distribution of large-seeded canopy food plants influenced the distribution of the relatively abundant Rhyticeros undulatus. The overall distribution of hornbills resulted in spatially contagious seed rain patterns for the large-seeded plant species. Patches with canopy food plants had a higher recruit diversity. Our results show positive feedback between distribution of rare but important hornbill food plants, hornbills and distribution of seeds and saplings of large-seeded plants in the landscape. Widespread loss of hornbills due to hunting and habitat loss in the region have likely disrupted these feedback mechanisms that are critical for tree species regeneration.},

  abstract = {Assisted colonisation that involves the planned introduction of threatened species has generated intense debates on its merits, such as mitigating habitat loss due to climate change impacts, and challenges, such as the risk of invasion by introduced species. Here, we assess the feasibility of Assisted Colonisation of the Narcondam Hornbill, a species confined to a 6.8\,km2 island in the Andaman Sea, onto other islands in the Andaman archipelago. Utilising IUCN's framework for species introductions, we evaluate the rationale for assisted colonisation and identify potential knowledge gaps that are critical for consideration. Based on the status of the Narcondam Hornbill population and its legally protected habitat, there is limited support for the assisted colonisation of the species to other islands as per IUCN's guidelines. However, if introduction is contemplated, we need to evaluate aspects like fruit availability on the new island, impacts of hornbill on endemic frugivores (especially those that are absent on Narcondam), influence of predators on introduced hornbill populations, low genetic diversity of Narcondam Hornbills and potential social impacts of introducing the hornbill on other islands. Given the restricted range of the species and vulnerability to stochastic events, systematic monitoring of Narcondam Hornbill populations and demography, minimising threats from avian disease and invasive rodents and potentially establishing a conservation breeding population in captivity with guidance from experts with experience in conservation breeding of hornbills is vital.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The importance of figs as keystone resources depends partly on their year-round fruiting pattern. However, most non-equatorial fig species show seasonality in reproductive phenology. If fig and other species' fruiting peaks coincide, the importance of figs as key resources during lean fruiting periods may be reduced. Fig and other forest tree phenology was studied in a deciduous and an evergreen site in the Western Ghats, southern India, from January 1991 to May 1992. In the deciduous site, most non-fig flowering and leaf flushing occurred during the two dry seasons, while most fruiting occurred during the dry and early wet seasons. In the evergreen site, all non-fig tree phenological stages -- flowering, fruiting and leaf flushing -- were concentrated during the two dry seasons annually (dry and post-monsoon). Individual fig trees produced crops one to three times annually, at different times of the year for different trees. Fig community fruiting peaks in the evergreen site coincided with fruiting peaks of the other forest trees, but in the deciduous site occurred slightly offset from non-fig fruiting peaks. The role of figs as key resources is likely to differ among forests, and to depend on factors such as diversity of fruiting pattern among fig species, fig tree density and territoriality of frugivores.},

The voluntary REDD+\,scheme offers a new framework for the protection of high deforestation landscapes, jurisdictions, and countries backed by international carbon finance. Here we analyzed the economic drivers of deforestation in Cambodia and the effectiveness of 3 REDD+\,projects vs. adjacent protected areas. We find that Economic Land Concessions were a predominant driver of deforestation in Cambodia and influenced the trajectory of illegal forest conversion in PAs. Furthermore, REDD+\,projects offer significantly more protection against deforestation than adjacent PAs in two of the three analyzed cases, likely due to enhanced funding enabling implementation of targeted community activities and rigorous monitoring and enforcement.},

  abstract = {Asian hornbills are known to forage and breed in fragmented rainforests and agroforestry plantations in human-modified landscapes adjoining contiguous protected forests. However, the factors influencing year-round hornbill abundance, demography and tracking of key food resources such as wild fig Ficus fruits in modified habitats and protected forests remain poorly understood. We carried out monthly surveys of two species of high conservation concern, the Vulnerable Great Hornbill (GH, Buceros bicornis) and the endemic Malabar Grey Hornbill (MGH, Ocyceros griseus) for 15 months and monitored ripe fig fruit availability for 12 months along 11 line transects (total length 24 km) in shade-coffee plantations and adjoining continuous rainforests in a protected area (PA) in the Anamalai Hills, Western Ghats, India. Both hornbill species used plantations and the PA year-round but distance sampling density estimates were higher in the PA in both nesting (GH by 57\%; MGH by 50\%) and non-nesting (GH by 53\%; MGH by 144\%) seasons. Relative to estimates from 2004 to 2005, mean GH density appeared stable or increasing, whereas MGH had declined by 39\% in the PA and by 56\% in plantations. Monthly encounter rate of both hornbills tended to be higher in the PA and that of MGH was also positively related to the density of fig trees with ripe fruit. Sex ratios of observed adult birds in the non-nesting season were relatively even (GH) or slightly female-biased (MGH), but became male-biased in both species during the nesting season when females were confined in tree-cavity nests. We used change in the adult sex ratio of observed birds from the non-nesting to nesting season to estimate an index of the proportion of adult pairs breeding at any point within the season, providing the first such estimates for any hornbill species. The proportion of breeding pairs was higher in the PA (GH -- 56\%, MGH -- 64\%) than in the plantations (GH -- 33\%, MGH -- 30\%). Although hornbills use shade-coffee plantations year-round, partly due to fig fruit availability, differences in hornbill density and breeding incidence, as assessed from the sex ratios of observed adult birds, indicate that plantations are a sub-optimal habitat for both species.},

Most nest sites were between 700 and 800 m a.s.l. (79\% of the total of 80 nests). Brown Hornbill nests were located in areas with a significantly higher altitude than were those of the Oriental Pied Hornbill.

  abstract = {Arboreal frugivores, such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species, they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers, and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species, Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share, often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages, with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year, overlap between groups (hornbill--primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate--primate and hornbill--hornbill), showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining forest structure.},

  abstract = {Asian forest hornbills play an important functional role as seed dispersers. Three of the large-bodied hornbill species in the Eastern Himalaya are declining globally. To understand their global population status, it is important to obtain reliable abundance estimates across their range. Protected areas are the strongholds for hornbill species in the Eastern Himalaya but differ in degree of disturbances and human pressures. We estimated the abundances of four hornbill species (Great Hornbill, Wreathed Hornbill, Rufous-necked Hornbill, and Oriental Pied-Hornbill) in the human-impacted Buxa Tiger Reserve in northern West Bengal. This is the first study in Asia to obtain abundance estimates of the hornbill species through comprehensive spatial coverage of the reserve. The densities of the three large-bodied species were low ({$<$} 1 bird per km2), while that of the small-bodied Oriental Pied hornbill was around 11 birds per km2. Abundance estimates ranged from a mean of 27 birds for the Rufous-necked Hornbill that is confined to the hilly areas to 161 for the Great Hornbill, 375 for the Wreathed Hornbill and 8050 for the Oriental Pied-Hornbill. Habitat quality was poor in most of the reserve with low tree density and basal area with only a few patches with higher tree density. Oriental Pied-Hornbills were associated with lower elevations and higher fruiting tree density. Despite the relatively low abundance of the large-bodied hornbill species, Buxa is an important site for hornbill conservation due to the presence of breeding populations and nests. While past and ongoing human pressures have resulted in habitat degradation, poaching pressures are low and hornbills are able to persist and breed in this landscape. Ecologically meaningful forest restoration with diverse native tree species is urgently needed to improve the habitat quality for hornbills and other wildlife.},

Although line transects appeared more suitable for long-term monitoring of hornbill populations, point-counts may be useful for large-scale surveys, especially where forests are fragmented and terrain is unsuitable for line transects. A standard fixed radius point-count method was used to sample different altitude zones (600--1,500 m) in the undisturbed site (342 point-counts) and fragments ranging in size from 0.5 to 2,500 ha in the Anamalais (389 point-counts). In the fragmented landscape, Malabar Grey Hornbill was found in higher altitudes than in KMTR, extending to nearly all the disturbed fragments at mid-elevations (1,000--1,200 m). Great Hornbill persisted in the fragmented landscape using all three large fragments ({$>$} 200 ha). It was also recorded in four of five medium-sized fragments (25--200 ha) and one of five small fragments ({$<$} 25 ha), which was adjacent to shade coffee plantations. Abundance of Malabar Grey Hornbill declined with altitude and increased with food-tree species richness. Great Hornbill abundance increased with food-tree species richness, suggesting that maintenance of high diversity of hornbill food species in fragments is important for their persistence. It is likely that the smaller and less specialized Malabar Grey Hornbill will survive in disturbed and fragmented forest landscapes, while Great Hornbill is more vulnerable to habitat alteration. Protection and restoration of rainforest fragments and food-tree resources, besides protection of existing large fragments, will aid the conservation of hornbills in the region.},

Since then, the situation has improved greatly and the Royal Government of Cambodia, in collaboration with international conservation NGOs, has been conducting general biological surveys across the country. Survey reports were used to investigate current occurrence of hornbills. Historically, three hornbill species --- Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis, Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus and Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris --- were known from Cambodia. Recent surveys show that populations of Great and Wreathed Hornbills have declined significantly since the 1960s, while Oriental Pied is still common. A fourth hornbill species, Brown Hornbill Anorrhinus tickelli, was reported in 1998 in Kirirom National Park spanning the border of Koh Kong and Kompong Speu provinces in south-west Cambodia. Conservation priorities and priorities for future surveys are being developed.},

  abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution. Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95\% CI 1613--3007) and 1705 (1212--2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep (Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400--1500 at that time. The 20--30\% increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.},

  abstract = {Hornbills are particularly important seed dispersers in tropical Asian forests, but most of the species in the region are declining. In addition, long-term data on the extent of the declines and how forest degradation impacts hornbills remain mostly unquantified. Here, we used multi-covariate distance sampling to estimate the densities of hornbills in 2021--2022 in Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary and Budo Su-Ngai Padi National Park protected areas in southern Thailand. These two sites are particularly useful for comparison due to differences in protection levels, with Bala being relatively less disturbed than Budo Mountain and because Bala was surveyed 20 years prior (2001--2002). Fig tree watches were also conducted in 2021--2022 to assess the potential impact of forest disturbance on hornbill visitation rates. Results indicated significant differences in hornbill densities between the two sites. The mean density of the Rhinoceros (Buceros rhinoceros) and Wreathed Hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus) was 3.2 and 5.1 times higher in Bala than in Budo, while the mean density of the Great Hornbill (Buceros bicornis) was 2.2 times higher in Budo than in Bala. The density of the Helmeted Hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) was notably lower than other hornbill species. There were also significant changes over the past 20 years in large hornbill densities, with Great Hornbill and Wreathed Hornbill significantly increasing, while the Helmeted Hornbill declined more than 90\,\%. Also, the probability of hornbills visiting fruiting Ficus trees was higher in the less-disturbed Bala than the Budo Mountain, making hornbills more reliable visitors in the less-disturbed site. We demonstrate the applicability of the multi-covariate distance sampling approach to estimate densities of rare hornbills, the negative impacts of habitat degradation on hornbills and the ecological role they play as seed dispersers. Additional surveys are needed throughout tropical Asia to establish further sites for long-term monitoring, especially in the Sunda region, where the Helmeted Hornbill is under extreme threat.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of hornbills breeding in hot, arid environments, raising concern about the species' persistence with climate change. Hornbills are, however, a widespread avian family found in various climates in Africa and Asia. In this study, we investigated the factors impacting the breeding phenology of three sympatric African hornbill species in a semi-arid environment. We found that rainfall was associated with breeding initiation and breeding success in all three species (African grey hornbill Lophoceros nasutus, Southern yellow-billed hornbill Tockus leucomelas, and Southern red-billed hornbill Tockus rufirostris). Breeding success and chick body mass change of African grey hornbills and Southern yellow-billed hornbills, but not Southern red-billed hornbills, were negatively impacted by high air temperatures during the breeding season. This study shows that Southern red-billed hornbills were more successful at producing offspring compared to African grey hornbills and Southern yellow-billed hornbills, which was likely due to their later breeding initiation compared to the other two species. Future changes in rainfall patterns may cause the African grey hornbills and Southern yellow-billed hornbills to delay breeding activities. Delayed breeding could result in a greater overlap of the nesting period of the three species, which would, in turn, increase the competition for food and suitable nesting sites. This study confirms that also in semi-arid areas, climate change has the potential to affect the breeding success of hornbills.},

  abstract = {Unsustainable hunting to supply wildlife markets is a global threat to bird species and a key driver of biodiversity declines across Africa. Despite well-documented negative impacts of wildlife trade on many bird species, such as Asian hornbills and African vultures, its consequences for African hornbills remain poorly understood. Here, we use data from both online trade and interviews with hunters in Cameroon to investigate the implications of foreign demand for African hornbills, using a twofold approach. First, we explored factors associated with the prices of hornbill skulls, the most heavily traded and expensive hornbill products, in online markets. Second, we examined the relationship between hunting pressure and market demand using semi-structured interviews with hornbill hunters and traders in Cameroon. In our online sales analysis, we considered factors including numbers of sales, species conservation status, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listing, body size, sex, and skull length (including bill and casque). In addition, we considered the number of sound recordings available for focal species, as this factor is highly correlated with species range size and may serve as a proxy for detectability in the field. We then used generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) to identify variables closely associated with the prices of hornbill skulls online. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to examine the relationship between hunting pressure and the local and foreign demands in Cameroon. We found that online trade included skulls and other products from 20 African and five Asian hornbill species, the latter of which were all CITES-listed. The median online price for a hornbill skull was {\pounds}117. Nearly half (nine out of 20) of the African hornbill species found in online trade were native to Cameroon. The three most heavily traded species---Yellow-casqued Hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), Black-casqued Hornbill (C. atrata), and White-thighed Hornbill (Bycanistes albotibialis)---accounted for 66\% of online hornbill products. Larger-bodied hornbill species classified as threatened, subject to CITES regulations, and species with higher numbers of sound recordings available tended to command higher prices online and thus likely face higher hunting pressure. We also found that foreign demand has a significant impact on hornbill hunting pressure, particularly among younger hunters. Approximately 73\% of Cameroonian hunters interviewed targeted hornbills, with 91\% of these motivated to acquire hornbill heads for trade, and 98\% intending to sell their products to foreign buyers. Our findings highlight the urgent need to address the negative impacts of international wildlife trade and implement measures to protect African hornbill populations from increasing threats of overexploitation.},

The objectives of this research were to predict hornbill distributions in Thailand and to assess the national conservation status of the species using extent of occurrence. We employed maximum entropy modelling, using 10 environmental variables that were believed to directly or indirectly influence hornbill distributions across Thailand, to predict the habitats potentially suitable for 10 of the country's 13 hornbill species. Data on the presence of hornbills were gathered from the Thailand Hornbill Project and additional field surveys in protected area complexes during 2004--2006. The results indicated that patch size is the most important factor affecting distribution, followed by latitude, ecoregion and distance to villages. All hornbill species were predicted to occur primarily in intact protected area complexes. The total extent of all hornbill habitats covers 9.3\% of the country's land area. Seven of the 10 modelled species are at risk and the current distribution pattern is expected to reflect stochastic extinctions because of small population size. We recommend that the conservation status of Austen's brown hornbill               Anorrhinus austeni               and Tickell's brown hornbill               Anorrhinus tickelli               should be changed from Vulnerable to Endangered.

Any good model of animal movement is built upon information about the animal's environment and the available resources including whether prey is in abundance or scarce, densely distributed or sparse               2               . Such an approach could enable the identification of certain quantities or measures from the model that are species-specific characteristics. We propose here a mechanistic model to describe the movement of two species of Asian hornbills in a resource-abundant heterogenous landscape which includes degraded forests and human settlements. Hornbill telemetry data was used to this end. The birds show a bias both towards features of attraction such as nesting and roosting sites as well as possible bias away from points of repulsion such as human presence. These biases are accounted for with suitable potentials. The spatial patterns of movement are analyzed using the Fokker--Planck equation, which helps explain the variation in movement of different individuals. Search times to target locations were calculated using first passage time equations dual to the Fokker--Planck equations. We also find that the diffusion coefficients are larger for breeding birds than for non-breeding ones---a manifestation of repeated switching of directions to move back to the nest from foraging sites. The degree of directedness towards nests and roosts is captured by the drift coefficients. Non-breeding hornbills show similar values of the ratio of the two coefficients irrespective of the fact that their movement data is available from different seasons. Therefore, the ratio of drift to diffusion coefficients is indicative of an individual's breeding status, as seen from available data. It could possibly also characterize different species. For all individuals, first passage times increase with proximity to human settlements, in agreement with the premise that anthropogenic activities close to nesting/roosting sites are not desirable.},

  abstract = {With land use change rapidly increasing in Asia, conservation prioritisation has emerged as an important tool in identifying critical landscapes for biodiversity to safeguard them from human pressures. In Peninsular Malaysia, the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS/BirdLife in Malaysia) developed a set of Criteria to identify Important Hornbill Landscapes (IHLs) -- hornbill hotspots which are conservation priority sites in Malaysia and serve to inform land use planning and conservation action. Application of the Criteria has so far been restricted to Peninsular Malaysia, thus in this study, we adapt it to Sarawak, a Malaysian state in Borneo that supports 80\% of the hornbill species diversity in the country. We expand on this conservation prioritisation methodology using Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt), to validate the Criteria's applicability and to identify potential IHLs in Sarawak. Our data sources included literature reviews, citizen science databases and interviews. Expectedly, survey effort was spatially biased. We identified eight IHLs, mostly concentrated in eastern Sarawak, across national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and forest management units. Existing published literature on the distribution of hornbill habitats in Sarawak corroborated with our MaxEnt outputs which aligned with the results of the IHL Criteria-based assessment, validating the latter and supporting its use in Sarawak. We additionally identified six potential IHLs based on MaxEnt outputs which confirmed the value of pairing MaxEnt with the Criteria-based assessment, for such a prioritisation exercise. To our knowledge, this study not only demonstrates the significance of combining MaxEnt and the Criteria for IHL identification, but it also represents the first application of the IHL Criteria outside of Peninsular Malaysia. Our findings can, therefore, serve as a case study for future applications of IHL Criteria in Borneo and potentially for other parts of Asia.},

Critical reduction of predicted ecological niches was observed in Anthracoceros coronatus throughout the period considered (2000--2100). Special conservation interventions are required for these two species. However, predicted suitable ecological niches for the Ocyceros gingalensis show little reduction towards the wet zone of Sri Lanka. This shift in species distribution boundaries coincides with periods of global warming suggesting a possible connection.

This study assessed the effect of anthropogenic disturbance on these two species in Lambusango forest, Buton, south-east Sulawesi. Data were collected between 2005 and 2007 in six study sites which varied in their levels of disturbance. Two of the lightly disturbed and two of the more heavily disturbed sites were within `protection forest' whereas the rest were classified as `production forest'. We used point counts with distance sampling to survey the hornbills. Habitat data were also collected at each of the points and related to hornbill `occupancy' with the program PRESENCE. Both hornbills were estimated to be at higher density in the lightly disturbed forest but the level of disturbance had more of a detrimental effect on Red-knobbed Hornbill than on Sulawesi Tarictic Hornbill. Lightly disturbed forest had significantly more large trees than the heavily disturbed forest but there was no difference in the abundance of figs. Using four covariates (disturbance level, protection status, number of large trees, and number of figs), 99\% of presence/absence of Red-knobbed Hornbills at the points could be explained by habitat disturbance and 87\% by forest status; the same covariates explained 76\% of presence/absence for the Sulawesi Tarictic Hornbill with abundance of large trees as the most important factor. These results support the notion that Red-knobbed Hornbill is more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and its conservation is highly dependent upon the preservation of forest habitats with low levels of disturbance.},
